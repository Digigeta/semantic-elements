    <h1> My Favorite Superheroes: A Semantic Webpage </h1>

    <h2> DC Heroes</h2>

    <p><em>Justice League Unlimited </em> is the <u>GOAT</u> animated superhero TV show. <br>
            Other great ones are Static Shock, Teen Titans, and Batman Beyond.</p>

    <h3><small>Marvel Heroes</small></h3>
    <p>Marvel cinematic universe stomps DC's attempts though. Except for The Dark Knight.</p>

    <h4>Conclusion</h4>

    <p> While Marvel's roster might be better overall, and the MCU has dominated like no other franchise ever, they fall short on critical acclaim.  </p>
    <blockquote>DC handidly wins the TV contest, and has the Dark Knight on the silver screen. </blockquote>
